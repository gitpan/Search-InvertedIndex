Search::InvertedIndex

 A general purpose inverted indexing system suitable for medium
 scale searching. The compiled external modules used are Digest::SHA1
 (needed because it uses the 'Tie::FileLRUCache' module for
 performance enhancment on searches) and DB_File (because it
 used by the 'Tie::DB_File::SplitHash' module). The module itself
 is Perl with the two exceptions noted above. If you have
 'Digest::SHA1' and 'DB_File' on your system, no compilation is
  required.

 It is designed to allow the easy 'plug in' of any wanted
 backend database in place of DB_File. Requires (as of now)
 'Digest::SHA1', 'DB_File', 'Class::NamedParms', 'Class::ParmList',
 'Tie::FileLRUCache', 'Tie::DB_File::SplitHash' and 'Test::More',
 modules for support. Additionally, it requires either 'Storable' or
 'Data::Dumper' to be installed for data serialization.

 Support for MySQL via DBI is also included.
 MySQL use requires that the DBI and DBD::mysql modules be installed.

 To enable running of the MySQL tests during installation, set the
 following environment variables:
  - either SII_TESTDB_NAME (name of database to run tests against)
        or SII_TESTDB_DSN  (DSN connection string for passing to DBI
                            - unless you know for sure that you need
                            this extra flexibility, use SII_TESTDB_NAME)
  - SII_TESTDB_USER (user to connect to database as)
  - SII_TESTDB_PASS (password of that user if required for authentication)
  - SII_TESTDB_HOST (hostname of the database server if not local)

 Note that these tests are destructive.  Do not run them against any
 database containing data that you wish to keep.

To install:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install
