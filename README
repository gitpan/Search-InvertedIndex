Search::InvertedIndex

 A general purpose inverted indexing system suitable for medium
 scale searching. The compiled external modules used are Digest::SHA1 
 (needed because it uses the 'Tie::FileLRUCache' module for 
 performance enhancment on searches) and DB_File (because it 
 used by the 'Tie::DB_File::SplitHash' module). The module itself
 is Perl with the two exceptions noted above. If you have
 'Digest::SHA1' and 'DB_File' on your system, no compilation is
  required.

 It is designed to allow the easy 'plug in' of any wanted 
 backend database in place of DB_File. Requires (as of now) 
 'Digest::SHA1', 'DB_File', 'Class::NamedParms', 'Class::ParmList', 
 'Tie::FileLRUCache', and 'Tie::DB_File::SplitHash' 
 modules for support.
